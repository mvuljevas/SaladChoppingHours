# SaladChoppingHours

SaladChoppingHours is a local React/Vite web application for reading a Salad
installation directory, detecting whether Salad is active, and calculating
weekly Chopping time toward Star Chef qualification.

## Current State

This repository has been aligned with the `react-vite-spa` template from the
local `AGENTS` repository and uses the `lean-context` workflow preset.

The application now has an initial dashboard for tracking Salad process status,
workload status, installation folder, weekly Chopping hours, and recent
log-derived signals. The selected architecture is a React/Vite browser UI backed
by a small read-only localhost helper for Salad file inspection and process
status.

The helper can report health, inspect known Salad processes, list bounded Salad
log metadata, read bounded log windows, and calculate recent Chopping-hour
history from miner log signals. The dashboard falls back to structured sample
data when the helper is not running.

The dashboard separates local 7-day Chopping history from Salad lifetime totals.
Displayed hour values include source, confidence, and coverage context so
partial local logs are not presented as complete account history.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer.
- npm 11 or newer.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the helper in a second terminal when you want local Salad status and log
metadata:

```bash
npm run helper
```

Watch local process, WSL, workload, and parser observations in a console:

```bash
npm run monitor
```

Optional helper configuration:

```powershell
$env:SALAD_INSTALL_PATH = "C:\ProgramData\Salad"
$env:SALAD_HELPER_PORT = "48173"
npm run helper
```

## Verification

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

## Planned Product Scope

- Read Salad logs and configuration from the local installation directory.
- Detect whether Salad and its workload service are currently running.
- Reconstruct Chopping intervals from local Salad miner log signals.
- Compare totals against the official Star Chef threshold.
- Present results in a local web interface without requiring an AI agent.

## Recommended Starting Point

- Template: `react-vite-spa`.
- App stack: React + Vite.
- Preset: `lean-context`.

The source `AGENTS` repository now contains the concrete
`templates/react-vite-spa/` directory, and this repository has adopted it.

## Version

The authoritative version source is `package.json`.
