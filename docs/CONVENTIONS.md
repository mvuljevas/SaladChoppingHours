# Conventions

This document defines repository-wide conventions.

## Repository Purpose

This repository will contain a local web app that calculates Salad Chopping
hours from local Salad installation data.

The repository currently stores workflow governance only. Product code should
not be added until the stack and first implementation block are confirmed.

## Documentation Principles

- Keep project rules explicit, portable, and stack-aware.
- Keep shared behavior in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/`.
- Update documentation when product scope, commands, architecture, security, or
  workflow decisions change.
- Prefer short rules that can be followed during real work.

## Required Documents

This project should maintain:

- `README.md`: project purpose, setup, usage, and documentation map.
- `AGENTS.md`: agent behavior and project-specific workflow rules.
- `.gitignore`: stack-appropriate ignored files.
- Authoritative version source, currently `package.json`.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: product direction.
- `docs/SNAPSHOTS.md`: chronological project memory.
- `docs/TECHDEBT.md`: accepted risks, shortcuts, and cleanup items.

Optional future documents:

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: system structure and technical decisions.
- `docs/SECURITY.md`: security model and sensitive filesystem workflows.
- `docs/adr/`: formal architecture decision records.

## Public Metadata

Do not include AI agent names, AI tool names, model names, provider names, or
generated-by signatures in public project metadata.

This applies to:

- Branch names.
- Commit messages.
- Pull request titles and descriptions.
- Tags and releases.
- Changelogs.
- README files.
- Product-visible text.

## Salad Data Handling

- Do not commit local Salad logs, tokens, generated runtime data, or copied
  installation directories.
- Treat Salad installation data as local user data.
- Document any filesystem access model before implementation.
- Prefer read-only access to Salad files unless the user explicitly requests a
  write operation.
