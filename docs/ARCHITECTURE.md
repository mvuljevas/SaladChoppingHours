# Architecture

This document records the current technical direction for SaladChoppingHours.

## Current Decision

SaladChoppingHours will use a local React/Vite browser UI backed by a small
read-only local helper process.

The helper will expose a localhost-only API for Salad installation inspection.
The browser UI will not attempt to read `C:\ProgramData\Salad` directly.

## Why This Model

Browser-only filesystem access is not enough for automatic Salad inspection.
A user-selected file picker flow would be safer than broad filesystem access,
but it would make recurring status checks and process detection awkward.

A desktop wrapper could work later, but it adds packaging complexity before the
core parser and calculation behavior are proven.

A local helper keeps the first implementation small while allowing:

- Read-only access to Salad log and configuration files.
- Local process status checks.
- A browser-based UI with a normal Vite development loop.
- A future migration path to a packaged desktop app if needed.

## Runtime Shape

```text
React/Vite UI
    |
    | localhost HTTP API
    v
Read-only local helper
    |
    +-- Salad installation files
    +-- Local process status
```

## Initial Helper Scope

The first helper implementation should be intentionally narrow:

- Read configured Salad installation paths.
- List relevant log files and basic metadata.
- Read bounded log slices for parser development.
- Report whether known Salad processes appear to be running.

The helper should not write to Salad files, modify system settings, or expose a
general filesystem browser.

## API Boundary

The UI should call purpose-built endpoints rather than generic filesystem
operations. Example endpoint shape:

```text
GET /health
GET /salad/status
GET /salad/logs
GET /salad/logs/:id/window
```

Exact endpoint names can change during implementation, but the API should keep
the same constraints:

- Bind only to localhost.
- Return structured JSON.
- Bound reads by size, path allowlist, and file type.
- Avoid returning secrets or unrelated local files.

## Implementation Notes

The helper language and runtime are not fixed yet. The next implementation
block should choose the smallest option that fits the existing Node/Vite stack.
A Node-based helper is the current default because the repository already uses
npm and can share development scripts.

## Deferred Decisions

- Whether to package the app as a desktop application.
- Whether to support non-Windows Salad installation paths.
- Whether to add authentication for localhost access.
- How to store user-selected Salad path preferences.
